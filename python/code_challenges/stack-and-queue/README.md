# Stack and Queue

A stack  order is First In Last Out (FILO).

A Queue order is First In First Out (FIFO)

## Challenge

Implementation Stack and Queue

**Stack: Create a Stack class that has a top property.**
the methods include stack class:

1. push
    Arguments: value
    adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
2. pop
    Arguments: none
    Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack
    Removes the node from the top of the stack Should raise exception when called on empty stack
3. peek
    Arguments: none
    Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
    Should raise exception when called on empty stack
4. is empty
    Arguments: none
    Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

**Queue: Create a Queue class that has a front property.**
the methods include Queue class:

1. enqueue
    Arguments: value
    adds a new node with that value to the back of - the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
2. dequeue
    Arguments: none
    Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue
    Removes the node from the front of the queue
    Should raise exception when called on empty queue
3. peek
    Arguments: none
    Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
    Should raise exception when called on empty stack
4. is empty
    Arguments: none
    Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty

### Approach & Efficiency

all methods in stack and queue take O(1)
